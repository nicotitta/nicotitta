## About me:
My interest in the cybersecurity field started to grow when I participed in the national **CyberChallenge.IT** competition and from then I have always been studying and practising with the goal of learning new skills and technologies. This deep interest drove me in the choice and writing of the bachelor's thesis: **Sandboxing tools and machine learning-based models aimed at detection and classification of Windows malware**.
